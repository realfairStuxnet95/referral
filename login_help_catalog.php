                                    <p>Here’s the info to get you back in to your account as quickly as possible.</p>
                                    <p>First, try the easiest thing: if you remember your password but it isn’t working, make sure that Caps Lock is turned off, and that your username is spelled correctly, and then try again.</p>
                                    <p>If your password still isn’t working, it’s time to <a href="#" id="password_reset_show">reset your password</a>.</p>
